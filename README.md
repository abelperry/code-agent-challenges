# code-agent-challenges
This repository contains the challenges for the code-agent project. You can use the subdirectories to solve the challenges.

## [state_transform](./state_transform/)
This challenge is about the state transform of the LLM dataset. You need to implement the `StateChecker` interface to check if the state transform is valid. And run the `state_test.go` to test your implementation.

## [sse_server](./sse_server/)
This challenge is about the sse server. You need to implement a sse server.

## [math_processor](./math_processor/)
This challenge is about the math processor. You need to implement a producer-consumer model to process the math expressions.

## [promotion_system](./promotion_system/)
This challenge is about the promotion system. You need to implement a strategy pattern to calculate the promotion amount.

## [log_analyzer](./log_analyzer/)
This challenge is about the log analyzer. You shoud use DDD to implement the web server which can analyze the log and return the result.

## [url_shortener](./url_shortener/)
This challenge is about the url shortener. You need to implement a production-level URL Shortener service. The backend language can be Go/C++/Rust/Java, and the emphasis is on layered design, pluggable storage, extensibility, and engineering practices.

## [rate_limiter](./rate_limiter/)
This challenge is about the rate limiter. You need to implement a distributed scalable Rate Limiter service. The backend language can be Go/C++/Rust/Java.

## [kv_cache_service](./kv_cache_service/)
This challenge is about the kv cache service. You need to implement a high-quality single-node Key-Value Cache service. The backend language can be C++ (建议 C++17 或更高), and the emphasis is on engineering, layered design, and replaceable infra.
